## Installation

To use this code, you need to have the MetaTrader platform installed on your computer. Follow these steps to install and run the Bill Williams Advanced Forex Robot:

1. Open the MetaTrader platform.
2. Click on 'File' in the top menu and select 'Open Data Folder'.
3. In the opened folder, navigate to the 'MQL4' folder.

## How It Works

The Bill Williams Advanced Forex Robot works by analyzing the market using three indicators: Accelerator Oscillator, Awesome Oscillator, and Fractals. It looks for specific conditions in these indicators to generate potential trading signals.

The expert advisor is initialized in the `OnInit()` function, where trading parameters and chart indicators are set. The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is removed from the chart, and it deletes the chart indicators.

In the `OnTick()` function, the expert advisor checks for potential trading signals using the values of the indicators. If the conditions for a buy signal are met, a long position is opened using the `trade.Buy()` function. If the conditions for a sell signal are met, a short position is opened using the `trade.Sell()` function.

In the `OnStart()` function, potential trading signals are displayed in the comment section of the chart.
